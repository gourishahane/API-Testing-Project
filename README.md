## QTrip API Automation Project

## Description
QTrip is a travel booking platform offering features such as user registration, city search, and reservations.This project focuses on automating the testing of QTrip APIs to validate their functionality, accuracy, and performance. By utilizing the Rest Assured framework and TestNG, we ensure seamless automation of API tests.
The project covers end-to-end API testing, including user registration, city search, and reservation functionality, and integrates these tests with the UI tests for comprehensive testing.

## Key Features
- Automated API tests for QTrip functionalities.
- Integration of API tests with UI tests using TestNG.
- Schema validation and response validation using Rest Assured.
- Designed reusable and maintainable test cases for scalable automation.
